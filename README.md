# Assesment for Byteridge
<p>A simple login app was given with 3 tasks to be performed on it</p>

<p><strong>Task : 1</strong> There are two roles in the app user and Auditor when user logs in he/she should be directed to "/" path, auditor should be directed to "/Audit" path ✔ (Implemeted) </p>

<p><strong>Task : 2</strong> Date manipulation Date should be modified and time conversion from 12 hours to 24 hours 😢 (Implemented on console but UI implentation is not done useState property giving error) </p>

<p><strong>Task : 3</strong> The data in the website is displayed as a list and Table representation is needed with Pagination 😢 (Table is implemeted, with odd and even in diff colors but pagination is giving errors so code is present but not implemented) </p>
